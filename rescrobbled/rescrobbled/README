Rescrobbled is a music scrobbler daemon. It detects 
active media players running on D-Bus using MPRIS, 
automatically updates "now playing" status, and 
scrobbles songs to Last.fm or ListenBrainz-compatible 
services as they play.

This SlackBuild will download all requisites, but
you need to have cargo and rustc. In order to use 
the software, you will need to have a config 
file. Please see the website (listed in slack-desc)
for configuration formatting instructions.
