If you need to use the last.fm integration, consider installing rescrobbled (also available in the repository), as it is broken in the program.

The package is too large for Github so it has been split into two parts. To join them back together:

cat tidal-hifi-*-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz.1 tidal-hifi-*-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz.tgz.2 > tidal-hifi-3.1.0-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
