tidal-hifi

tidal-hifi is an Electron-based wrapper for the Tidal music streaming service 
web client. It is differentiated from other wrappers because it properly 
integrates Widevine and therefore offers the ability to listen to Hi-Fi songs.
You will need Node.js in order to build the SlackBuild. You may need a Widevine
library installed in order to listen to Hi-Fi. 

Last.fm scrobbling does not work; a workaround is to use rescrobbled.
