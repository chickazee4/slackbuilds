Chaotica Fractals

Chaotica is a next-generation fractal art application, designed for 
both novices and professional artists.

Novice users can enjoy editing randomised fractals to produce 
stunning HD wallpapers and animations.

Professional users will particularly value the fast, modern rendering 
engine. High quality animations and huge images for print are easily 
produced, with real-time imaging controls that will dramatically 
accelerate your workflow.

This does not have any unusual dependencies and should work out of
the box on an up-to-date Slackware system.

This supports 64-bit Slackware systems only.
